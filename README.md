It seems that it is impossible or very difficult to guess the number from 1 to 1000 using only 10 attempts. But it can be done using just one algorithm.
As I later found out, it was a Binary search algorithm that is actively used by neural networks and AI.
Initially, it was game guess the number from 1 to 100 and included 12 lines of code, but after understanding which algorithm is used, I decided to make the game more difficult and better.
In the last change, I wrote the error codes. I think this game can be improved, for example, to make a user interface using the PyQT or PyGame libraries.
